## Simon Says Game


## Preview 

This is a Simon Says game.  The goal is for a player to follow sequences of increasing length.  Once a player has an incorrect move or entry, the game ends.

## Technologies Used
javaScript, CSS, and HTML used.  DOM manipulation is used freqently.



## Approach Taken

Four squares (divs) created and had event listeners and styling added.  Created a randomly generated sequence using the Math Random and Math floor functions.  random sequence was stored in an array. player moves were tracked and stored in a unique array.  The array populated with the players move is compared against the random sequence array.  if they match, the game goes to the next round and another color is added to the sequence.  if the user fails to match the random sequence, the game will show a "GAME OVER" message.
